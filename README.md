# vocabTest
The idea of this repo is to just have a file with 1 line with your vocabulary
If you want to test your vocabulary, replace the current line with your vocabulary description. If the resultant page (http://oeg-upm.github.io/vocabTest/site) is produced successfully, then add your entry to the vocab repo: https://github.com/oeg-upm/vocabUpdates.
