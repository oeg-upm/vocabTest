# vocabTest
The idea of this repo is to just have a file with 1 line per  vocabulary you want to test.

If you want to test your vocabulary, replace the current line with your vocabulary description. Then commit the changes.

While the system is working you can check the status of the server and jobs: http://jarsomatic.linkeddata.es/
